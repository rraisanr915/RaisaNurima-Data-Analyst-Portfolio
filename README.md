## Introduction
Welcome to my first project portfolio! In this portfolio, I am excited to present my work on a SQL and Power BI project focused on analyzing online retail data for a UK-based non-store online retailer. The dataset comprises transactions recorded between December 1, 2010, and December 9, 2011. The retailer specializes in selling unique gifts suitable for various occasions, with a significant portion of its customer base consisting of wholesalers.

## Project Objectives:
The primary objectives of this analysis are as follows:
- To gain valuable insights into the retail operations, customer behavior, and sales trends,
- To answer key questions and provide data-driven recommendations for decision-makers,
- To showcase the capabilities of SQL and Power BI in extracting insights from real-world retail data.

## Dataset Source:
The dataset used for this project is in CSV format and can be accessed on Kaggle at the following link [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ulrikthygepedersen/online-retail-dataset). This is a table containing transaction records for a specific period and serves as the main data source for analysis.

## Methods Employed
For this project, I employed a combination of SQL and Power BI for data analysis:

- SQL was used for data cleaning, transformation, and aggregation.
- Power BI was utilized to create interactive and informative visualizations.

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
The dataset underwent comprehensive data cleaning and preprocessing steps, including:

- Addressing NULL values.
- Data type conversions.
- Deleting Irrelevant Rows
- Creat additional columns 
- Dealing with duplicate rows in the dataset.

The SQL script used for data cleaning and preprocessing can be found ![here](Online_Retail.sql)

- __Average Order Value__:The average order value for this year was $533, offering insight into typical customer spending behavior over the entire year.
- __Total Sales by Month__:A monthly sales trend analysis revealed fluctuations throughout the year, with November 2011 as the highest-grossing month and February 2011 as the lowest. These trends can inform demand forecasting and inventory management strategies.
- __Customers by Country__:The analysis identified the United Kingdom as the country with the highest number of customers, highlighting a significant domestic customer base.
- __Total Sales by Country__:The United Kingdom emerged as the top contributor to total sales, underlining its significance within the market.
- __Top 5 Selling Products by Quantity__:The analysis pinpointed the best-selling products by quantity, with "Paper Craft, Small Birdie" leading the pack, followed by "Medium Ceramic Top Storage Jar," "World war 2 glider asstd design," "Jumbo bag red retro spot," and "White hanging heart t-light holder." This knowledge can guide inventory management and marketing decisions.
- __Transaction Status(%)__:Transaction statuses were distributed with 98.27% of transactions being successful and 1.73% as cancellations, providing an overview of transaction outcomes and potential areas for improvement.
- __Transaction Trends by Day and Time__: Use the Heatmap table to analyze transaction data to identify patterns in customer behavior throughout the week and within a 24-hour period. The analysis shows that Thursdays are consistently the busiest days of the week for transactions, and noon is the highest transaction volume on a daily basis; this information highlights the specific day of the week and time of day when most transactions occur.
