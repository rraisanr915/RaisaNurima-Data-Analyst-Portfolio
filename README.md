## Introduction
Welcome to my first project portfolio! In this portfolio, I am excited to present my work on a SQL and Power BI project focused on analyzing online retail data for a UK-based non-store online retailer. The dataset comprises transactions recorded between December 1, 2010, and December 9, 2011. The retailer specializes in selling unique gifts suitable for various occasions, with a significant portion of its customer base consisting of wholesalers.

## Project Objectives:
The primary objectives of this analysis are as follows:
- To gain valuable insights into the retail operations, customer behavior, and sales trends,
- To answer key questions and provide data-driven recommendations for decision-makers,
- To showcase the capabilities of SQL and Power BI in extracting insights from real-world retail data.

## Dataset Source:
The dataset used for this project is in CSV format and can be accessed on Kaggle at the following link [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ulrikthygepedersen/online-retail-dataset). It contains transaction records for the specified period and serves as the primary data source for the analysis.

## Methods Employed
For this project, I employed a combination of SQL and Power BI for data analysis:

- SQL was used for data cleaning, transformation, and aggregation.
- Power BI was utilized to create interactive and informative visualizations.

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
The dataset underwent comprehensive data cleaning and preprocessing steps, including:

- Addressing NULL values.
- Data type conversions.
- Deleting Irrelevant Rows
- Creat additional columns 
- Dealing with duplicate rows in the dataset.
